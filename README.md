===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.

My game is very easy to play! Simply use the up, down, right and left arrows to get the player across the screen. If she collides with an enemy bug, she'll 
automatically be sent back to start, and you can try again. If she makes it all the way to the water, you win (and then you start again). Enjoy!
